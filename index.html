          <p>Fear is a natural emotional response to danger or uncertainty. In modern life, it often arises from imagined threats or past wounds.</p>

          <h4>🧠 In the Body</h4>
          <p>Fear activates your fight-or-flight system. It tenses muscles, increases heart rate, and clouds your thinking.</p>

          <h4>🌬️ Why We Release</h4>
          <p>You no longer need fear as your compass. Releasing fear makes space for peace and trust in life.</p>

            <li>Close your eyes. Take 3 deep breaths.</li>
